## Communication

Always respond in English only. Do not write replies in Mandarin, Chinese, or any other language, even if the conversation context contains them.

## Development

This is an npm-workspaces monorepo (`apps/web`, `apps/services`, `apps/blog`). When starting the dev server, run it from the target app directory and use background mode:

```
cd apps/web    # or apps/services
astro dev --background
```

Install dependencies from the repo root with `npm install`. Manage the background server with `astro dev stop`, `astro dev status`, and `astro dev logs`.
